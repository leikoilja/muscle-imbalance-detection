The wearble device used in this project was created using the resource provided by Advancer Technologies: http://www.advancertechnologies.com/2013/03/diy-conductive-fabric-electrodes.html


Materials:
- soft fabric knee brace
- conductive fabric
- sewing kit (needle, thread, pins)
- wires to attach to circuit
- copper mesh
- soldering iron and solder

The basic steps are as follows: 
1. Solder the copper mesh onto the end of the wire that will attach to the electrode. This gives a larger surface area of contact between the wire and the conductive fabric. 
2. Cut out pairs of rectangular strips of the conductive fabric (1 pair = measure one muscle). We used strips approximately 2x3cm in size.
3. Take the knee brace, turn it inside out, and pin the fabric electrodes in the place you'd like them to be. Both fabric electrodes should be positioned on the same muscle, at different positions. They will measure the electrical potential difference across the muscle when it is activated.
4. Carefully position the copper mesh between the knee brace and conductive fabric. Sew the conductive fabric into place, which should also hold the copper mesh in place. 
5. Repeat step 4 for all electrodes.
6. If possible, weave the electrical wires through the knee brace fabric to help secure them in place. They should all feed back to the location that you want to mount the circuitry (we did this on the side of the thigh). 
7. Use a few drops of water to wet the electrode surface before use. This helps improve the contact between the skin and electrode.
